# Logfile for processes in FFMPEG through pydub (service/transcoder.py).
# Look here if something doesn't seem to work like intended, but doesn't throw exception.

# This is by default turned off to save memory, implemented as an option for debugging. 
# Set ffmpeg_logging to True in the settings.py file to activate this feature. 

# Note: Tests will append to this file so make sure you don't mix up actual errors with test errors.
